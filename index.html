                             <h3>About</h3>
                             <p>Congressman Jim Cooper was born and raised in Tennessee. He and Martha,
                                  his wife of twenty eight years, live in Nashville and have three children.

                                A New York Times columnist recently called him "the House's conscience, a
                                 lonely voice for civility in this ugly era" and a "tart-tongued moderate" who "seeks
                                  bipartisanship on fiscal matters and other issues in a polarized political climate." 
                                  USA Today named him one of the "Brave 38" of a "tiny band of heroes" in Congress for
                                   his work on a bipartisan budget plan.
                                
                                In Congress, he's known for his work on the federal budget, health care and government reform. </p>
                             <p>WASHINGTON – Today the House passed an amendment introduced by Rep.
                                  Jim Cooper to the Strength in Diversity Act, which reinstates an 
                                  Obama-era grant program that was cut by the Trump administration,
                                   to reduce racial and socioeconomic isolation in public schools.</p>
